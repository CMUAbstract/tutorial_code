Mods to libraries are as follows:

maker:
-change Makefile.env to get rid of paths to llvm, we have it installed natively.

alpaca:
-Removed a couple of flags in Makefile so it works with new version of llvm

TODO: redirect pacarana subdirectory to tools/pacarana/Pacarana instead of
ext/libpacarana

To run tasks pass:
opt -load path/to/tasks.so -tasks path/to/app/tutorial.a.bc -o temp.out
