Here's a list of the delays used to burn the voltage on init for the peripherals
disbaled version down to the starting levels for different peripheral setttings.

TODO: figure out how to do get an apples-to-apples comparison here.

gyro_init_fifo_tap (XL at 833Hz, tap sense enabled): voltage drops to ~2.253V,
                                                                ~207200 cycles
gyro_init_datarate_hm(0x70,1): voltage drops to ~2.21V, ~350000 cycles
